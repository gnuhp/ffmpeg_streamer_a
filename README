20121004: Status

Video / audio is UP and runing: 

Video : use java surfaceholder and draw on Canvas. 
        callback from native whenever image is received. (not optimized but work for now)
Audio : use java PCMPlayer (inherited from MSC3 app) 
        Can support both PCM & adpcm (decode to PCM in native before return to java )
        callback from native whenever sound is decoded (can do in background: however need to implement buffer management)

HOW TO BUILD: 

1. Build x264 
cd jni/x264
./build_android.sh 
cd ..

2. Build ffmpeg (using 0.10.3) 
cd ffmpeg-0.10.3 
./build_android.sh 
(long time)
cd .. 

3. Build the rest
cd /home/phung/workspace/FFMpeg
ndk-build 
(this will build libmediaplayer, zjni and copy all libraries to java accessible location) 


Back To Java (Eclipse)
Refresh the code base
Run the test app. 






20120921: FFMPEG work status



On Linux, able to compile the test app that can pull data from rtmp stream , no real audio/video playing supported. 
Location: 
/home/phung/workspace_c/test_sdl/ffmpeg-0.10.3
    ./build_linux.sh - stripped down config file 

/home/phung/workspace_c/test_sdl/libmediaplayer
    make clean all --> libmediaplayer.a (needed by testApp)

/home/phung/workspace_c/test_sdl/libmediaplayer/testApp
    make clean all
    ./testApp 



On Android, Built ffmpeg-0.10.3 with the same configuration as above (check build_android.sh and build_linux.sh)
Location: 
/home/phung/workspace/FFmpegTest - simple app trying to open file and get info 
        Can open flv file, and able to read h264 format, flv format 
        Can't open stream yet. 
           error: "..Cannot open connection tcp://192.168.5.106:1935"

/home/phung/workspace/FFMpeg - streaming app under development 
Stage 1: try to port over the mediaplayer + JNI interfaces. 
ISSUE: some issue with JNI code. May need to simplify the current implementation. 
       Arrive at the same error as app above with hardcording mediaplayer creation inside setDataSource (jni call)
       --> same status -- can't open stream yet. 

Stage 2: implement audio / video support 
 --- NOT STARTED---
